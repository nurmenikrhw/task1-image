# Car Detection & Classification System

This project implements a car detection and classification system using deep learning.
The system detects cars from images or videos using YOLO, then classifies the detected cars
into several categories using a CNN-based classifier.

## Features
- Multi-car detection using YOLO
- Car type classification (Hatchback, MPV, SUV, Sedan, Truck)
- Supports image and video inference
- Designed for Indonesian road vehicle types

## Model Architecture
- Object Detection: YOLO (CNN-based)
- Classification: CNN (PyTorch)
